# Battery Percentage Chat App
You are only allowed to be friends with people who are within 5% battery percentage of you.

In this world where everyone is trying to be inclusive we want to bring some completely unneeded change and make sure that you are only friends with people who are within 5% battery percentage of you. This is a simple app that will allow you to see the battery percentage of your friends and only be friends with people who are within 5% of you.
